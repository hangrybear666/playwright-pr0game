# TODO List for [Your Project Name]

## Unfinished Tasks

### High Prio
- Reinitialize Session after timeout within any interaction. Maybe by catching the error and calling the setup again.
- Test what happens if I spam the REST API endpoint with multiple start commands

### Medium Prio
- Make timeouts of expects work even though the test has no timeout itself. Either give each expect an individual timeout, or find a global solution.

### Low Prio
- asd

### Bug Fixes
- asd
