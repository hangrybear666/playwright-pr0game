# TODO List for [Playwright pr0game]

## Unfinished Tasks

### High Prio
- Reinitialize Session after timeout within any interaction. Maybe by catching the error and calling the setup again.

### Medium Prio
- add resource deficit calculation to determine how long we have to wait before rechecking if resources are available.

### Low Prio
- Test what happens if I spam the REST API endpoint with multiple start commands
- Make timeouts of expects work even though the test has no timeout itself. Either give each expect an individual timeout, or find a global solution.


### Bug Fixes
